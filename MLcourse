THE FUTURE OF BUSINESS
Entrepreneurship is about more than building a product and launching a business.
It’s about conditioning your mind to attack problems head-on, find innovative solutions, cope with extreme resource limitations, communicate a vision of something that doesn’t exist, and navigate complex human relationships.
Exosphere’s entrepreneurship course will empower you with new mental models to balance these competing demands while pushing you to focus on executing on the launch of your MVP day after day.

“The only thing worse than starting something and failing… is not starting something.”
Seth Godin, Squidoo founder, author and blogger

## FAQ

What kinds of people attend the Exosphere Academy?
The Exosphere Academy (EA) programs attract people from all different stages in life. There have been 16 year olds who wanted to learn new skills during their summers, both current college students and those who skipped the traditional university experience, people in their 30s who were looking for a fresh start in a different field, and even some over 50 who realized it’s never too late to learn new skills and start making a change.

I am an absolute beginner with zero experience or knowledge in the subject matter. Are your courses still for me?
Yes! All of our courses have been developed so that any person, no matter their past experience, background, or skills can join. We work with personal education plans for each student which allow you to get the most out of the course under any circumstance. 
EA is most interested in curious and motivated individuals who are willing to put in the hard work that it takes to learn new skills and build solutions to real problems. People who wake up and commit to solving the problems of that day, no matter the size or shape.

Can I attend the program remotely?
No. This program is on-campus and by being so, fosters cross-pollination of ideas and collaboration among different fields. We have found that actually living and working together yields greater benefits and provides more opportunities to develop transdisciplinary projects, build longer-lasting relationships, and reliable networks.

Do I need to quit my job and/or studies to attend?
That depends on your plans for after the program and the options available to you in your current situation. This is an immersive program that will require around 30 hours of your time just for the in-person content. This number does not include time spent working on projects, collaborating with other students, social activities, and study/research time. 
If you have doubts about your time commitment, mention this in your application and we will talk to you about how we can tailor the program to suit your availability and needs.
