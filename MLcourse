THE FUTURE OF BUSINESS
Entrepreneurship is about more than building a product and launching a business.
It’s about conditioning your mind to attack problems head-on, find innovative solutions, cope with extreme resource limitations, communicate a vision of something that doesn’t exist, and navigate complex human relationships.
Exosphere’s entrepreneurship course will empower you with new mental models to balance these competing demands while pushing you to focus on executing on the launch of your MVP day after day.

“The only thing worse than starting something and failing… is not starting something.”
Seth Godin, Squidoo founder, author and blogger

## FAQ

What kinds of people attend the Exosphere Academy?
The Exosphere Academy (EA) programs attract people from all different stages in life. There have been 16 year olds who wanted to learn new skills during their summers, both current college students and those who skipped the traditional university experience, people in their 30s who were looking for a fresh start in a different field, and even some over 50 who realized it’s never too late to learn new skills and start making a change.

What does the schedule look like?
Each day starts at 8AM. 
There is a mandatory daily discussion, activity, or briefing to get you focused and in the right frame of mind. Stream sessions start at 9:30AM and go until 12PM. Lunch is allotted 60 minutes from 12PM to 1:00PM. The stream sessions will resume from 1:00 - 2:30PM. 
The core curriculum sessions will cover topics such as emerging technology, transhumanism, sociology, communication, business development, sales & marketing, and more. These will be on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 3:00 - 5:00PM. Tuesday and Thursday will be open work / open office time where students can continue to work on projects and skill development. 
There will be a wide mix of sessions including activities, theory, lectures, workshops, and discussions. The weekly schedule of the core sessions and each stream will be posted every Sunday evening so that you will know what sessions are being taught in order for you to be able to plan ahead. 
Saturday is for reflection, review, and catch up from the week activities. Sunday you are encouraged to unplug from electronic devices and do something relaxing, preferably outside.

I am an absolute beginner with zero experience or knowledge in the subject matter. Are your courses still for me?
Yes! All of our courses have been developed so that any person, no matter their past experience, background, or skills can join. We work with personal education plans for each student which allow you to get the most out of the course under any circumstance. 
EA is most interested in curious and motivated individuals who are willing to put in the hard work that it takes to learn new skills and build solutions to real problems. People who wake up and commit to solving the problems of that day, no matter the size or shape.

How do I sign up?
No one likes bureaucratic application processes, so we’ve made it pretty simple to sign up. You enter your information into the signup page. You will answer some questions, enter basic contact info, and choose the course. It won’t take more than a few minutes to complete. 
You will then receive an email within 24 hours from a team member to talk about your desire to attend the next term. 
There is only one thing that you and the team member must agree upon. And that is, considering your goals, ambitions, and what you want to learn, do you/we think that Exosphere Academy can help you achieve these things? 
If both agree, then you are in! You would have a week to pay a non-refundable deposit to hold your spot. After payment, we invest in you and your future immediately! Starting with building your customized learning plan and helping arrange logistics.

How many hours am I expected to commit each week?
Courses work (class time) will be around 20 hours per week with core sessions ranging from 10-15 hours per week. Saturday is an open day for reflection, studying, and catching up on work. Sundays are encouraged to be for unplugging from electronics and resting.

Will there be homework?
There are no tests or grades here. Learning is a constant and continual process, but it’s also a lot of work. Your efforts will be evaluated so that you can improve in the areas you are lacking, and try to perfect the areas where you excel. We cannot promise there will not be “homework.” But we can promise that if there is, it’s there for a reason and will benefit you.



Can I attend the program remotely?
No. This program is on-campus and by being so, fosters cross-pollination of ideas and collaboration among different fields. We have found that actually living and working together yields greater benefits and provides more opportunities to develop transdisciplinary projects, build longer-lasting relationships, and reliable networks.

## Personal Questions

# How much money should I budget for the 8 weeks?
The program’s tuition covers the program content, housing (a shared apartment with other participants). For personal expenses we recommend around $250-300 USD per month for food. 
This number varies according to what lifestyle you want to have during the 8 weeks. Because of the dynamics of the program and living with other participants generates a strong sense of community, participants usually share a lot of meals together, visit local markets, and save money. Having meals with other people is also a big part of the engagement and relationship building that is important at EA.

# Do I need to quit my job and/or studies to attend?
That depends on your plans for after the program and the options available to you in your current situation. This is an immersive program that will require around 30 hours of your time per week just for the in-person content. This number does not include time spent working on projects, collaborating with other students, social activities, and study/research time. 
If you have doubts about your time commitment, mention this in your application and we will talk to you about how we can tailor the program to suit your availability and needs.
